However, it's important to note that the code uses fixed credentials, which is not a secure practice for real-world applications. In production scenarios, it's better to use more secure and flexible methods for handling credentials, such as using environment variables or external configuration files. Additionally, the code assumes that the latest email is in plain text format and may not handle all possible email structures. In real-world applications, you may need to consider different email formats and content types."
